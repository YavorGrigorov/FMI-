#lang racket

; Idea for prolog interpreter with racket
;  prolog works by looking at a tree of all possible paths
;   get code -> gen tree -> find first true path (e.g. rets #t) ;
;   -> gen bin code for where we are ( '11011')
;   -> ret the true outcome and when asked for recalc go with the ecoding and
;         ret next true and chnge code


(define (member? el l)
  (if (null? l) #f
      (or (equal? el (car l))
          (member? el (cdr l))
          )
      )

;  example b.kids = [1 2 3]   path = [a c b]
